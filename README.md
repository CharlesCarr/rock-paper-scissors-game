# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Built a user vs. computer Rock, Paper, Scissors game with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript

## Project Description

I built this for fun to practice Vanilla JavaScript. I built this with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Originally, I built this for a single game but later I added a round tracker to allow for more competition and to play the first to 3 round wins.
  
A few areas of focus for this project include:   
- Allowing user to select a button for Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Generating a random number to represent the computer selection
- Tracking the round score and ending the game with new UI to show a winner and prompt a new game  

### How To Play

This Rock, Paper, Scissors Game is a user vs. the computer game. The user selects rock, paper, or scissors with clicking the respective button images. The computer then displays its selection and the score above the selection is updated with the round winner. After each round, the user makes another selection and the game coninues for the first to 3 round wins as the overall winner. (If there is a tie, the score is not updated and the user continues to the new round.) After the game is over, the user is asked if they would like to play again and can select the 'New Game' button to refresh to a new game.
